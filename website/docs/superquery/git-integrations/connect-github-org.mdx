# Connecting your GitHub Organization to superQuery

:::info
This article is for those who are connecting superQuery to their GitHub Organization. If you'd like to connect to a personal repository instead, refer to [this post](connect-github.mdx).
:::

:::tip
**Only GitHub** [**Organization Owners**](https://help.github.com/en/articles/permission-levels-for-an-organization#permission-levels-for-an-organization) **have the permissions required to set up superQuery at the organization level.** If you're not an Owner, please share this post with an Owner on your team.
:::

In order for your team to connect superQuery to repos in your GitHub organization, you'll need to ensure all permissions are set for the superQuery GitHub application at the Organization level.

## Step #1: Access Organization settings

In GitHub, click on your profile icon and then on "**Settings**"
