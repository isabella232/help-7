# Navigating superQuery

This post will cover the fundamental parts of the superQuery UI.

superQuery is broken down into five sections:

1. Resource Panel
2. SQL Editor
3. Results Grid
4. Visualize Toggle
5. Right pane

Let's briefly cover the main capabilities of each section.

## #1 &mdash; Resource Panel

The resource panel contains eight resources, each represented by a unique icon.

### Boards

[Boards](../superquery-editor/organizing-queries.mdx) are like folders, where you can organize your queries by topic, theme, project. Think of them as a filing & management system for your queries.

### Resources

Access all of your BigQuery projects and resources for other supported services (AWS Athena and DynamoDB) here.

### Schema

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line -->
[![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/162587680/541666f1e4269e9b643dfa05/schema.png)](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/162587680/541666f1e4269e9b643dfa05/schema.png)

View columns of the table(s) being queried in your current query tab.

[Schema](../superquery-editor/schema.mdx) is automatically detected based on the tables queried in your SQL.

### Query History

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line -->
[![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/162595843/e4ad30227edb768a9248e820/scheduled.png)](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/162595843/e4ad30227edb768a9248e820/scheduled.png)

Query history displays the previous queries you've executed in superQuery and BigQuery.

### Scheduled Queries

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line -->
[![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/162595797/4e75d0213a3a869dc4799b1d/queryhistory.png)](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/162595797/4e75d0213a3a869dc4799b1d/queryhistory.png)

Manage and edit your [scheduled queries](../scheduled-queries/managing-scheduled-queries.mdx) here.

### Source Control

![](../../../static/img/superquery/SourceControl.png)

Connect your [GitHub repository](../git-integrations/connect-github.mdx) or [GitLab project](../git-integrations/connect-gitlab.mdx) to superQuery.

Once connected, it's easy to back up queries, catalog them, and version-control them.

### Dark Mode / Light Mode toggle

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line -->
[![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/162599071/f72cc1a9feb8d955beeff11e/theme+toggle.png)](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/162599071/f72cc1a9feb8d955beeff11e/theme+toggle.png)

Toggle between Dark Mode and Light Mode with a single click.

* View and change your billing plan
* Connect your Google Cloud Storage bucket to save downloaded CSV results there.

### #2 &mdash; SQL Editor

The SQL Editor is where you write your queries. In the editor, you have the following capabilities for analyzing data faster and more efficiently.

#### Query Tabs

Organize your queries into [tabs](../superquery-editor/query-tabs.mdx) that you can name & easily identify later.

Tabs allow you to work across multiple queries in one window. The SQL persists across sessions, similar to how you work in a Google Doc &mdash; meaning you won't lose your work if you refresh the page or close your session.

With tabs, you can easily jump between queries you're working on.

#### Query Cost Calculator

Know your query's cost before executing it. Avoid costly mistakes and query with transparency.

#### Variables

[Variables](../superquery-editor/variables.mdx) are placeholders for values that can change.

When you find yourself constantly updating a WHERE clause, then variables can be useful.

They make your queries more readable and allow you to perform quick changes on your query without modifying the SQL itself.

#### Autocomplete

Write queries faster using SQL Autocomplete.

#### Share query tab

[Share a query tab](../superquery-editor/query-tabs.mdx#share-tab), or an [entire Board](../superquery-editor/organizing-queries.mdx#share-a-board), with your team.

![](../../../static/img/superquery/ShareQueryes.gif)

#### Manually commit queries to GitHub or GitLab

Use [Manual Commit](../git-integrations/add-commit-messages.mdx) to add a message to your Git commits, or if you want to commit a change without running the query.

### #3 &mdash; Results Grid

In your results grid, you can:

* View, explore, and export query results.
* [Generate a quick visualization](../superquery-editor/charts.mdx) of your query result.
* Preview tables and views and see their details.
* Make changes to views and [commit them to Git](../git-integrations/version-control-views.mdx)

![](../../../static/img/superquery/ChartsSQ-1.gif)

### #4 &mdash; Dashboard View

The **Visualize** toggle transforms the latest results of all of your query tabs into a [dashboard](../dashboards/create-dashboards.mdx) in one click &mdash; no exporting required.

![](../../../static/img/superquery/VisuallizeSQ.gif)

### #5 &mdash; Right Pane

Your right pane (highlighted below) is separated into the following features

* [Schedule Query](../scheduled-queries/schedule-query.mdx) &mdash; schedule your current tab's SQL to run at a regularly scheduled interval
* [Query Tab Settings](../superquery-editor/tab-settings.mdx) &mdash; modify settings for your query tab like billing project, destination table, and more
* Full-Screen Mode &mdash; expands your editor view
* A "More Options" button which opens
  * Format Query &mdash; formats your current tab's SQL
  * Save View &mdash; saves your current query as a view
  * Save To &mdash; saves your current query tab to a different board
  * Download SQL &mdash; downloads your current query tab's SQL into a .sql file
