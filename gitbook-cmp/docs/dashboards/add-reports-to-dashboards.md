# Adding Reports to a Dashboard

CMP Dashboards help you visually track and analyze key cloud data points & metrics. Create personal dashboards, project dashboards, team-specific dashboards and more, depending on what you would like to track more closely.

Adding [Cloud Analytics Reports](../cloud-analytics/create-cloud-report/) into [customizable dashboards](customizing-dashboards.md) gives you an at-a-glance view of your most important cloud infrastructure data points.

Add your report to a dashboard by clicking the 'Add to dashboard' icon in the upper right-hand corner of the report.

Next, select which dashboard(s) you'd like to add the report to. You may also toggle the report to be addable from the [Widget Library](widgets-overview.md).

Additionally, you may also add a report to a new, yet-to-be-created dashboard. To add the report to a new dashboard, click on the "**NEW DASHBOARD**" button, give your dashboard a name, and click "**Save**".

Check the box of the newly-created dashboard to add your report there as well.

Next, navigate to your dashboard(s) to view the report(s) you added.

From there, you're free to [customize](customizing-dashboards.md) the size and arrangement of the widgets as you see fit. Note that report data displayed in the widget will refresh every four hours.

Finally, if you'd like to quickly navigate to your report to investigate further or edit something, you may click on the report's name in the widget.
