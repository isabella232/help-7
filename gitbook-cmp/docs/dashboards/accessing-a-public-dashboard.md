# Access Public Dashboard

To access a dashboard that someone else in your organization has made public, select the _Attach_ button from the right-hand side of the dashboard navigation bar:

A modal dialog will open with a drop-down menu allowing you to select which dashboard you want to attach. Select the _Attach_ button when you have made your choice.

After selecting _Attach_, you will be taken to the dashboard, and a new button will be added to the left-hand side of your dashboard navigation bar.

An arrow icon will appear if you hover over the new button on your dashboard navigation bar. Selecting the arrow will display a drop-down menu with two options:

1. _Set As Default_ &mdash; Sets this dashboard as your default dashboard
2. _Detach_ &mdash; Removes this dashboard from your dashboard navigation bar
