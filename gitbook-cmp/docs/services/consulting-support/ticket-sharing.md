# Enable ticket sharing

By default, CMP users can only view their own tickets. When you enable ticket sharing, users in your organization will be able to view each other's tickets.

Ticket sharing can be useful when multiple people are responsible for opening support tickets and would like to provide additional visibility.

From within the CMP, select _Services_ from the top navigation bar, then select _Consulting and support_:

Select the gear icon in the top right-hand corner of the page, then select _Enable Ticket Sharing_.

After selecting _Enable Ticket Sharing_, all users will be able to view all tickets.

You can use the gear icon to disable ticket sharing at any time.
