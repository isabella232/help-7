# Managing Invoices

As a customer, you can access your company invoices, including their full details and the actual invoice documents.

Within the CMP, select _Billing_ from the top menu bar, then select _Invoices_:

You can filter the invoices per billing profile to which it was issued, and by issue date of the invoice. To filter the invoices, use the drop-down controls at the top of the page.

In addition, there is the option to download the invoice summary as a CSV file by clicking the download icon (cloud with a downward arrow) in the top-right corner of the page.

There are five possible statuses for invoices:

1. **Open** &mdash; shows the amount owed and due date of the payment.
2. **Canceled** &mdash; canceled removes the charge but remains listed in your Sales Invoices history for review if necessary.
3. **Paid** &mdash; the amount was delivered and approved.
4. **Partially Paid** &mdash; the total amount was not fully delivered and has yet to have been approved.
5. **Past Due** &mdash; invoice due date of payment has passed.

By clicking on an invoice number (e.g., **IN1940032243**) you can review additional details of the invoices such as detailed invoice lines. There is also the option to view the document as a PDF file.

If you would like to pay for an invoice now, select the _PAY NOW_ button in the top right-hand corner of the screen.
