# External Services We Use

We rely on several third-party services which you may need to allow access to via your personal firewall. These are the mandatory services for Cloud Management Platform to function:

```text
https://*.googleapis.com
https://accounts.google.com
https://apis.google.com
https://fonts.gstatic.com
https://*.stripe.com
https://*.stripe.network
https://*.plaid.com
```

These services are optional and they help us to make Cloud Management Platform better:
