# Exchange rates

When DoiT International charges in local currency, we convert prices pursuant to the conversion rates published by leading financial institutions. Like many other large companies, we are using [Fixer](https://fixer.io) to obtain historical currency exchange rates.

{% hint style="info" %}
We will not notify you for increases in non-USD prices that are due to currency conversion fluctuations.
{% endhint %}
