# Consulting and support

DoiT International provides unlimited consulting and support for Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, our Cloud Management Platform.

As a customer, you are not limited to any number of tickets or by how much time DoiT International invests in supporting you as a client.

For more information about the services we offer, please visit the [Services](https://www.doit-intl.com/services/) page on our main website.

{% endhint %}

## View tickets

From within the CMP, select _Services_ from the top navigation bar, then select _Consulting and support_:

By default, the _Consulting and support_ page lists all of your current request tickets. You can use the _Filter tickets_ input field to filter the list of tickets.

If there are any current [cloud incidents](cloud-incidents.md), they will be displayed above the list of tickets, as shown in the screenshot above in yellow.

You can use the gear menu in the top right-hand corner of the page to [enable ticket sharing](ticket-sharing.md) or [manage the default email CC](manage-default-email-cc.md).

{% hint style="info" %}

When you first visit the _Consulting and support_ page, your browser may prompt you to allow notifications. If you select _Allow_, the CMP will notify you whenever one of your tickets (or a ticket you are CCed on) is updated.

{% endhint %}

## Create a new request

{% hint style="info" %}

For simple questions and trivial requests, you can skip the ticket creation process (below) and, instead, send a message to your [shared Slack channel](shared-slack-channel.md) for a quick response from our engineering or support staff.

{% endhint %}

Select the _NEW REQUEST_ button (shown in the previous screenshot) to create a new consulting or support request.

After selecting _NEW REQUEST_, the CMP will take you through the steps of creating a new request:

1. Select the _Cloud Platform_, _Product_, and _Resource_ so that we can route your ticket to the most appropriate engineer.

   {% hint style="warning" %}

   The CMP will display a list of any current [incidents](cloud-incidents.md) related to the cloud platform you select during this step.

   If one of the current incidents appears to be related to your request, you may still open a ticket with DoiT International. However, likely, we are already working with the cloud vendor to address the issue.

   {% endhint %}

2. Select the severity of your request. Each severity level corresponds with a target response time:

   * General Guidance &mdash; Four hours
   * System Impaired &mdash; Two hours
   * Production System Impaired &mdash; One hour
   * Production System Down &mdash; 30 minutes

3. Write a descriptive subject, add any additional CCs to the ticket, and provide a complete description of your request.

   {% hint style="info" %}

   In some cases, the CMP may automatically add your cloud vendor representative (e.g., account manager or customer engineer) to the list of _Additional CCs_. Please feel free to remove their email addresses if you do not wish to copy them on your ticket.

   {% endhint %}

At any point, select the _BACK_ button to return to a previous step.

To complete your request, select the _SUBMIT_ button.
