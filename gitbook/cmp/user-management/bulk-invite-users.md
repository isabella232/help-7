# Bulk Invite Users

Whether you're just creating your team in the CMP or simply want to add a lot of new teammates at once, bulk inviting users will save you lots of time here. From within the CMP, you can invite as many users as you want by uploading a CSV file.

Begin by selecting the _Settings_ icon (a gear) from the top menu bar, then _Identity and access_:

Next, select the vertical ellipsis icon in the top right-hand corner of the screen to open the upload and download menu.

To bulk invite users, select the _Upload Users_ option, and then upload a CSV file with the user information.

To ensure your CSV file is structured properly, download the template below and use it to format your bulk invitations.
