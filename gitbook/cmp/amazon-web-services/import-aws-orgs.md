# Import AWS Organizations

## Overview

Customers having their own AWS Organizations (and willing to preserve them after switching to DoiT billing) have a new, radically simple onboarding process which eliminates most of the hassle typically involved with consolidation process.

### Step 1 &mdash; Readiness (by Customer)

After signing a contract with AWS, your customer success manager would contact you to provide you with an onboarding process overview and guide you through the readiness phase. A typical process would be as following:

1. Identify the root AWS account in your AWS Org (normally referred as Master Payer Account or MPA)
2. In the MPA, create a new IAM user with "Administrator" policy
3. Change an MPA root email address to one provided by DoiT (usually this would follow a awsops+{{ID}}@doit-intl.com pattern)
4. Remove 2FA from the root account (no worries, we'll re-enable it in the next step)]
5. Notify your customer success manager about completing the steps 1&ndash;4

### Step 2 &mdash; Initial Onboarding (by DoiT)

1. Change the root password on AWS MPA account
2. Re-enable 2FA on the root account
3. Create `doitintl_cmp` IAM role to facilitate access from Cloud Management Platform
4. Create `CloudHealth` IAM role to provide access from CloudHealth
5. Create `AWSAdmin` IAM role (used to access billing data under AWS Channel Reseller Program)
6. Request SPP team at AWS to onboard the organization under ECAM (End-Customer Account Model)

### Step 3 &mdash; Account Configuration (by DoiT)

1. Replace existing payment method with a DoiT payment method
2. Set tax profile to the country matching DoiT's billing profile
3. Complete Org email verification process (need to be done because the root email has changed)
4. Enable "Cost and Usage Reports" (if not enabled already)
5. Create a new S3 bucket (named as `doitintl-awsops-{id}`) to store AWS Cost and Usage report
6. Set up a new Cost and Usage report (`doitintl-awsops-{id})`)

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Should I expect anything to break during the process?**

No, the process was designed to be disruption free.

**Q: Will the features dependent on AWS Organizations continue to function?**

All AWS-organization features (e.g. AWS SSO, AWS Backup, AWS Firewall Manager, Resource Manager, etc) will continue to function in exactly the same way as before.

**Q: Can you please share the IAM policies for the roles you're creating on master payer account?**

Absolutely! You can find the policy for DoiT Cloud Management Platform at [this gist](https://gist.github.com/spark2ignite/e2a5a23fc6d239837cc3765cc0db024d).
